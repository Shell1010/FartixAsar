# FartixAsar
A custom app.asar intended to fix bugs with the current asar and probably improve upon it. Only reason I'm doing this is because I , there is no actual game modifications, it's just improvements to the launcher itself.

Please tell me if something breaks, not really doing much testing because I only really play AQW and if that works then I'm assuming the rest does too.

## Additions
- `Ctrl + i` launches dev tools, applies to game windows too (access assets)
